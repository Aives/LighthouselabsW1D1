    <p>I am seriously excited to learn more about the languages and technologies that web developers use. I have learned a little HTML and CSS myself using <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/">Code School</a> and John Duckett's book, <a href="http://www.htmlandcssbook.com">HTML & CSS: Design and Build Websites</a>. I also had help in the form of a project from my cousin who is currently working in the field, but I feel I need a much more structured learning program. So I am ecstatic to use what I have learned thus far and incorporate it into what I will learn here to build a website.</p>
