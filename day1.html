    <p>
      I am <em>seriously</em> excited to learn more about the languages and technologies that web developers 
      use. I have learned a little HTML and CSS myself using 
      <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/">Code School</a> 
      and John Duckett's book, 
      <a href="http://www.htmlandcssbook.com">HTML &amp; CSS: Design and Build Websites</a>. 
      I also had help in the form of a project from my cousin who is currently working in the field, 
      but I feel I need a much more <em>structured</em> learning program. <span>So I am <strong>ecstatic
      </strong> to use what I have learned thus far and incorporate it into what I will learn here 
      to build a website.</span>
